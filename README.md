# Covid19-Data-Project
## Covid-19 Dashboard

This project is a data analysis and visualization of COVID-19 data using SQL and Tableau. The project involves querying COVID-19 data in SQL, transferring it to Tableau, and creating an interactive dashboard to visualize and explore the data. This project is a way to showcase what I have learned from the SQL and Tableau courses I have taken on coursera over the past months.

### Tools
Google BigQuery Sandbox was the platform used to query the data with SQL and Tableau Public was used to further filter the data, create the visuals, and compose the dashboard

### Data
The data for this project was downloaded from Our World in Data in October 2022, up to date data can be downloaded here: [Covid-Deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), [Covid-Vaccinations](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations).

### Links
The queries I used to explore and analyze the data are available [here](https://github.com/ZHowser/Covid19-Data-Project/blob/main/Covid19_Exploration.sql) and the Tableau visualization I created is available on my [Tableau Public profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zach2412).
